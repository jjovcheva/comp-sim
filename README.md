## Computer Modelling and Visualisation ##
This repository contains some of the scripts, plots, and visualisations for projects I completed during my computing courses at the University of Edinburgh.
- `LJ` simulates Argon atoms interacting under the Lennard-Jones potential at different phases
- `cellular-automata` explores the evolution of a deterministic system (the Game of Life) and a stochastic system (the SIRS model) on a lattice
- `pdes` explores initial and boundary value problems by solving the Cahn-Hilliard and Poisson equations on a lattice, and tests the convergence of different algorithms for the latter
